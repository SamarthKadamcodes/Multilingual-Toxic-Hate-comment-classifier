Multilingual Toxic Language Detection using BERT

📌 Overview

This project implements a multilingual toxic language detection system using transformer-based models (BERT / HuggingFace Transformers).
It evolved from a logistic regression prototype into a deep learning-powered multilingual model, capable of detecting offensive/abusive content across multiple languages.

## 📌 Concept
The goal is to detect harmful or toxic language in text comments using traditional **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques combined with **Logistic Regression**.  
This baseline model demonstrates how classical machine learning methods can be applied to text classification tasks.
